# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js


npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js

npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/FCT.js --network localhost

```

```
You are running Hardhat Ignition against an in-process instance of Hardhat Network.
This will execute the deployment, but the results will be lost.
You can use --network <network-name> to deploy to a different network.
